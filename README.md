# GeometricLayouts-Frontend

## Summary
This is the frontend for my GeometricLayouts project ([full details](https://github.com/jomonty/GeometricLayouts)). It's a simple website to showcase one part of the server functionality, namely the api/geometry/verticesbygridref route. It's currently [hosted](https://geometric-layouts-frontend.vercel.app/).

## Getting started
I used pnpm for package management, but npm commands will work fine for the below.

* Clone and run the .NET server available [here](https://github.com/jomonty/GeometricLayouts)

* Clone the repo, navigate to the directory in a terminal window and run
    ```sh
    pnpm install
    ```
* Then run the web app in development
    ```sh
    pnpm run dev
    ```
